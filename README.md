# LearnscapeToolkit

The aim of this toolkit is to provide a free to use collection of gamification elements for the browser. The elements are specifically tailored for learning experiences but no creativity should ever be restricted. That is why we would be glad to see the toolkit in different settings, too. 

## Contributing

As we want to build the largest toolkit in the context of gamification, this project will be ever ongoing. 
So, your help and pull requests are very welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
